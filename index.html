    <h2>Theme</h2> 
    <p><b><i>A huge theme to acknowledge in this film is the idea of nature vs. nurture. Estella was raised by a caring mother who always tried to “love her into shape” as Cruella herself states it. Try as she might, Estella could never quite tame those wild inclinations. Near the end of the movie, it is revealed that the stone-cold, heartless Baroness is the real birth mother of Cruella. The strong-willed ambition of The Baroness is evident in Cruella, and the cutthroat ruthlessness peaks out at times, but ultimately Estella makes a sacrifice to be with her mother, leaving Cruella her rightfully earned riches and top spot in the fashion world. However, she decides to ultimately spare the life of The Baroness, which is notably opposite the decision of the Baroness concerning Estella’s adoptive mother all those years ago.</b></i></p>

    <h2>Deep Dive: Cruella</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>She’s cruel. She’s a devil. If she doesn’t scare you, no evil thing will. She’s ruthless. She’s a menace. She’s… likeable? </li>
        <li>Cruella de Vil has been hailed as a puppy-killing – but fashionable – villain since the 1950s.<br> Now it seems that this infamous character has taken the path of many re-told Disney villain stories and become more of a quasi-relatable antihero.</li>
        <li>The Cruella seen in the 2021 film is vastly different from the original in Dodie Smith’s The Hundred and One Dalmatians in 1956.</li>
        <li>Smith painted Cruella as a married socialite who was incredibly spoiled and even had a pet cat. </li>
        <li>Though later versions diverge from this original portrayal, her taste for fur coats has always been present to some degree. </li>
        <li>The next version of the cruel devil came about in the early 1960s. Animator Marc Davis brought to life the crazed, wiry-haired terror who was always shrouded in green smoke.</li>
        <li>The next Cruella made her grand entrance with Glenn Close’s 1996 version of the voguish, successful, and humorous icon.</li>
        <li>This was the first time an audience experienced a Cruella that was not just evil, but entertaining. This portrayal of a likable and witty “villain” was the first step in the direction of a relatable (or at least understandable) Cruella.</li>
        <li>She is someone we hate to love and love to hate; we like her because we aren’t supposed to. This concept of Cruella is exactly what is shown in the newest movie.</li>

<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly;">
    <img style="margin-right: 10px;" src="https://rebbiereviews.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/cruella-child.jpg" alt="young age" height="200" width="250" align="left">
    <p>In 1964 England, Estella is a creative child with a talent for fashion, but is ostracized for her black and white hair and develops a nefarious streak. Her mother, Catherine, decides to move them to London, stopping at a party at a mysterious mansion called Hellman Hall on the Suffolk coast to ask the host for money. Sneaking inside, 
        Estella loses her mother’s necklace while being chased by the host's ferocious Dalmatian dogs, which push Catherine off a cliffside balcony to her death. Orphaned, Estella runs away to London and befriends street urchins Jasper and Horace.<br>
        Ten years later in 1974, Estella practices thievery and grifts with Jasper and Horace, honing her fashion skills by designing their disguises, alongside their dogs, Buddy and Wink. For her birthday in 1977, Jasper and Horace get her a job at the Liberty department store, but Estella is made a janitor and denied the chance to use her talents. 
        She drunkenly redecorates the window display and impresses the Baroness—a renowned-but-authoritarian haute couture fashion designer—who offers her a coveted job at her fashion house.

    <h2>The rise</h2>

    <p>
        To conceal her identity, Estella creates an alter-ego, "Cruella", and wears one of the Baroness's old designs from a vintage clothing store owned by the flamboyant Artie. At the ball, Cruella steals the spotlight as Jasper and Horace break into the Baroness's vault, but they realise that the baroness is already wearing the necklace. Jasper improvises and releases rats into the party, allowing Estella to swipe the necklace. The Baroness summons her Dalmatians with a dog whistle, and Estella realizes the Baroness caused Catherine's death. In the ensuing chaos, one of the Dalmatians swallows the necklace. Seeking revenge, Estella orders Jasper and Horace to kidnap the Dalmatians, and recovers the necklace. Cruella upstages the Baroness at various events in extravagant fashions, gaining notoriety via society columnist Anita Darling, Estella’s childhood friend. Furious, the Baroness fires her lawyer, Roger Dearly, while Cruella's increasingly haughty behavior discomforts Jasper.
       The night of the spring show, the Baroness opens the vault to find that the entire collection has been destroyed by thousands of moths, having emerged from the beads on the dress which were actually moth cocoons.

    <p>
        Estella is saved by John, the Baroness's valet, who reveals that the necklace unlocks a box containing Estella’s birth records: the Baroness is her biological mother. She had ordered John to murder the infant Estella to focus on her career and keep her late husband's inheritance. Instead, John gave the baby to Catherine, one of the Baroness's maids, who raised Estella in secret.Cruella breaks Jasper and Horace out of prison and reveals the truth, recruiting them, Artie, and John for her final scheme. The quintet sneaks into the Baroness's charity gala, having arranged for all the guests to dress as Cruella. Estella confronts her mother on the balcony, and the Baroness feigns an embrace before pushing her over the cliff, unwittingly witnessed by her guests. Estella secretly survives with a hidden parachute and, now legally dead, adopts her Cruella persona for good. The Baroness is arrested, swearing revenge on Cruella. Before her "death", Estella willed her inheritance to Cruella, including the manor which she renames from Hellman Hall to "Hell Hall", moving in with her accomplices.
